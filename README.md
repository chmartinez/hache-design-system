# hache-design-system
An attempt of doing a design system.

The idea is simple: now that I'm acting as a PO, I spent less time coding and more time finding problems. BUT, since I don't want to stay away from code, I come up with this idea of #tenLinesOfCodePerDay.

With this repo, the idea is to start adding components, based on https://dashkit.goodthemes.co/components.html. Ten lines of code at a time.



# Restrictions
None


# Structure
None!
I'm doing this to keep up with the coding, not to build the best DS ever. We'll see how it goes...


# Rules

## Things that don't count as part of the challenge

* `chore` commits (unless I'm doing some crazy magic I'm proud of ü§¥üèΩ).
* `docs` commits (unless if they help the development and the "open-sourcesness". For example, saying how to run the project, components docs or explaining the rules üòâ).
* Moving files from one place to another.

# Todo
- [ ] Check https://github.com/proksh/atomize. They have a cool way of setting default style values (kinda complicated but aligned with my thought process).
- [ ] Keep adding love to the `Alert` component.
