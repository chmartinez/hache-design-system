# hache-design-system
An attempt of doing a design system.

The idea is simple: now that I'm acting as a PO, I spent less time coding and more time finding problems. BUT, since I don't want to stay away from code, I come up with this idea of #tenLinesOfCodePerDay.

With this repo, the idea is to start adding components, based on https://dashkit.goodthemes.co/components.html. Ten lines of code at a time.



# Restrictions
None


# Structure
None!
I'm doing this to keep up with the coding, not to build the best DS ever. We'll see how it goes...


# Rules

## Things that don't count as part of the challenge

* `chore` commits (unless I'm doing some crazy magic I'm proud of ü§¥üèΩ).
* `docs` commits (unless if they help the development and the "open-sourcesness". For example, saying how to run the project, components docs or explaining the rules üòâ).
* Moving files from one place to another.

## Notes
- [ ] Check https://github.com/proksh/atomize. They have a cool way of setting default style values (kinda complicated but aligned with my thought process).

## Configs for VSCode
Create a `jsconfig.json` file at root level and put this:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```
That should allow VSCode to detect the folders inside `src` as "aliases" (so you can avoid the `../../mystuff` imports).

# Todo
- [x] Add tests to the new component.
- [x] Add dismissable alert functionality.
- [x] Try to fix the issue with author's name in git commits
- [X] Add styles to alert.
- [x] Add `onDismiss` callback. No need to: if the alert needs it, then I'll add it. Not before.
- [x] (Alert) Add support for custom content
- [x] Find out how to setup aliases within a create-react-app (probably will imply VSCode changes) .
- [ ] Refactor/Add love to the `Alert` component.
